Petrol and diesel cars contribute a lot to global warming, so a solution must be made to reduce to effect of global warming as seen 
in Figure 1 (Wilberforce et al 2017). Electric cars offer one solution, but it may not be the best, this paper aims to investigate 
to pros and cons of both hydrogen powered and electric powered cars and how this could benefit the Earth. As you can probably see,
nearly all car manufacturers are focused on electric cars rather than hydrogen(Carwow staff 2022), this is partly because of the 
risks of hydrogen power and the cost of developing the necessary technology to make hydrogen power work (Albatayneh Aiman et al 2023).
This would indicate that right now at least, electric cars are the best alternative over the petrol and diesel cars that dominate 
the market(Albatayneh Aiman et al 2023).

In the pursuit of environmentally friendly transportation solutions, the automotive industry has seen significant advancements in 
recent years. Among these, hydrogen-powered and electric vehicles have emerged as promising alternatives to the petrol and diesel 
vehicles, offering the potential to address pressing environmental concerns and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Hydrogen fuel 
cell vehicles and battery electric vehicles each present a unique set of advantages and disadvantages. The primary goal behind this 
paper is to provide an assessment of the pros and cons associated with these two groundbreaking technologies. By comparing these 
eco-friendly options, we aim to shed light on the critical factors that influence their adoption into everyday use, energy 
efficiency, infrastructure, and economic feasibility. With a global shift toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating 
climate change, understanding the strengths and limitations of hydrogen and electric cars is vital. Hopefully by the end of this 
paper, you will have learned a bit more about hydrogen powered cars and why they aren’t ready to be the future.

Hydrogen car technology is rapidly getting more advanced and more capable of becoming mainstream but right now, electric cars
are leading the way in the push for a more sustainable future. In 2009 General Motors R&D chief Larry B said"It was the world's
first 300-mile drive that was petroleum-free and emissions-free on a single tank of fuel"(Service, Robert F, 2009) this feat was 
done by a hydrogen car which shows the potential of this technology, however, a big downside to hydrogen which was similar to the
problem of electric cars is the lack of infrastructure (Wilberforce, Tabbi El-Hassan et al, 2017). The lack and any 
infrastructure means that people can’t really drive these vehicles as there are no facilities to re fuel or repair when something 
goes wrong. This is a very similar situation to the electric car, because even a few years ago, the infrastructure couldn’t 
support the number of cars on the road, but now there are lots of electric charge points. So could this mean if the technology 
of hydrogen cars improves then the infrastructure will rapidly improve as it did with the electric car. As seen in figure 2 
(Service, Robert F, 2009) if we continue to use petrol and diesel cars, by 2070 we would have added another 500 million tons
of CO2 into the atmosphere, and this can’t carry on as we are already seeing the effects of global warming today like the 
global average temperature has increased by 2°C (NASA 2023). However, using hydrogen cars will make the most difference 
and the fastest difference in reducing the effect of global warming. The one problem with this model is that every car will 
have to turn into a hydrogen or electric car to achieve this and obviously we can’t do this instantly, but it does give a 
good indication that if we put the effort in to reduce the number of fossil fuel cars then this will have a positive impact 
on the environment. Now a bit on how both these technologies work, in an electric car the electricity is stored chemically
in the batteries and then converted back onto electrical energy which drives the motor which drives the wheels 
(Carwow staff 2022). This is quite a simple system which is about as reliable as the mainstream petrol and diesel cars. 
Hydrogen cars on the other hand are a lot more complicated, they work by compressing hydrogen (“as hydrogen is far less
energy dense than petrol/diesel so must be compressed to get enough of the stuff on-board” (Carwow staff 2022)) and then 
transferring that into a fuel cell which splits the atoms and makes electricity and water, the electricity is then used 
to drive the wheels, so a hydrogen powered car is basically an electric car with a hydrogen power station to make the
electricity rather than taking it form the mains (Carwow staff 2022). A big positive of hydrogen powered cars is that 
they have a very long driving range compared to electric cars, with a range of about 500km (Wilberforce et al, 2017).
This is about the same range as a petrol-powered car and about 50% better than an average electric car, which is positive
as one of the main drawbacks of the electric car is the range; as well as the time it takes to replenish the charge 
which as most people know, it takes hours to fully recharge an electric car while an hydrogen car can take 3-5 mins 
also like the petrol powered cars, this shows the potential that hydrogen cars have to become the future of 
transportation. Another positive of the hydrogen cars is the fact that we make over 50 million tons of hydrogen per 
year globally which is enough to fuel 200 million cars (Michael F Hordeski, 2012).  Most of this hydrogen goes to 
waste so using it in cars is a very productive solution, on the other hand it will be very expensive and take a long
time to make a system to transport all this hydrogen and compress it to be used in cars. In conclusion, powering cars by 
hydrogen is a very interesting solution to the growing problem of global warming but right now at least it isn’t viable.
A few car makers have tried a few hydrogen cars but haven’t seen much success while the electric car industry is where 
everyone is going. So, it seems to me that electric cars are the future but if we can find a way to transport hydrogen
on an industrial scale and make hydrogen a safer, cheaper and more viable fuel source it has the potential to
mitigate the effects of global warming. Granted those are a lot of issues but to save the planet, it might 
well be worth it. Thank you for reading.
